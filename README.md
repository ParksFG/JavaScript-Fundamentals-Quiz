# JavaScript Fundamentals Quiz

## Description

I made this project to focus on my skills with javascript and web APIs.  I didn't feel too comfortable with more advanced javascript nor writing out web APIs.  This project was really difficult to start with, but I ended up finding a groove a bit later in the project.  I was finding myself easily recollecting what I needed, however the biggest thing this project taught me was the important of psuedo-code.  Hopefully I remember to update this project so I have a nice litte reference quiz for the JavaScript fundamentals.  Maybe more advanced quizzes in the future?

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
